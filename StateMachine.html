                    <u><b>Week 1: Getting Started</b></u><br>
                    
                    As we kick off our project to prepare for the 
                    World Solar Challenge, the team and I dove 
                    straight into action. Our first task was to
                    install the horn wires through the steering
                    column. Additionally, I began laying out a 
                    plan for the embedded team, outlining how we
                    would get the STM (presumably referring to a
                    microcontroller) and the Dash up and 
                    running. It's exciting to see the project 
                    taking shape!<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 2: Research and Development</b></u><br>
                    
                    This week was all about research and development.
                    We delved into programming the STM for the state
                    machine for our new battery. This is a crucial 
                    step in ensuring the efficient functioning of
                    our solar car.<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 3: Building the Foundation</b></u><br>
                    
                    We made significant progress this week by starting
                    to program the STM for the battery box. Currently,
                    we have a basic state machine set up, which will 
                    serve as the foundation for more complex 
                    operations in the future. It's great to see our 
                    plans taking shape in real code.<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 4: Progress Update</b></u><br>
                    
                    This week, we completed the skeleton of the state machine.
                    While there's still work to be done, having the basic
                    structure in place is a significant milestone. Next,
                    we'll be integrating it into the appropriate IDE and 
                    adding more code to handle specific states. Progress 
                    might seem slow, but every step forward brings us 
                    closer to our goal.<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 5: Optimizing Efficiency</b></u><br>
                    
                    We spent this week diving deeper into the IDE and 
                    optimizing the efficiency of our state machine. It's 
                    essential to ensure that every part of our code is as 
                    efficient as possible to maximize the performance of our 
                    solar car. Learning more about the IDE and fine-tuning 
                    our code will pay off in the long run.<br>

                <p><u><b>Week 6: Continued Development</b></u>

                    Continuing our momentum, this week was all
                    about refining the code for our state
                    machine. Every line of code brings us 
                    closer to a fully operational system.
                    While there are still challenges ahead,
                    we're confident in our progress and 
                    excited about what's to come.<br>

                    <u><b>Week 7: Shifting Focus</b></u><br>
                    
                    Taking a short break from the state machine,
                    we shifted our focus to the tablet<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 8: Back to the Basics</b></u><br>
                    
                    This week, we returned to the 
                    state machine code, making significant progress.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Week 9: Spring Break</u></b><br>
                    
                    Taking a well-deserved break, we stepped away 
                    from thee state machine code nearly 
                    complete, we spent this week putting on 
                    the finishing touches. Once the code was
                    finalized, we tested it with the PCBs, 
                    and everything worked perfectly. It's a 
                    fantastic feeling to see all our hard 
                    work paying off!<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Week 10: Getting Closer</u></b><br>
                    
                    As we returned from spring break, we dove back 
                    into our work with renewed vigor. This week, we 
                    made significant strides in the state machine 
                    code, with only a few states left to create. It's
                    exciting to see the finish line in sight!<br>

                    With thk, we returned to the state
                    machine code, making significant progress. 
                    We also spent some time working on the tablet
                    code, ensuring that both aspects of our 
                    project are moving forward in tandem. It's 
                    all about finding the right balance and 
                    keeping our project on track.<br>

                    <u><b>Week 12: Testing, Testing, 1-2-3</b></u><br>
                    
                    This week was all about testing. With the
                    help of Jonathan, we finalized the state
                    machine code and put it through its 
                    paces. After rigorous testing, we're 
                    happy to report that everything is 
                    working as expected. It's a significant
                    milestone for our project!<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 13: Shifting Gears</b></u><br>
                    
                    With the StateMachine code completed, we 
                    shifted our focus to the tablet. Our goal 
                    is to use Flutter to create a user-friendly
                    interface and establish a USB connection 
                    with the CAN bus. It's all about making 
                    our solar car as efficient and 
                    user-friendly as possible.<br>
                    <br>
                    <u><b>Week 14: On the Home Stretch</b></u><br>
                    
                    This week was a busy one as we spent long 
                    hours at the shop with the team, working to
                    get the car up and running. After 
                    extensive effort, we successfully got the 
                    car working and conducted initial testing.
                    While there's still work to be done, 
                    we're closer than ever to our goal. Next 
                    up, we'll finish the wiring, get the 
                    cams and lights working, and establish 
                    telemetry. The finish line is in sight, 
                    and we're more motivated than ever to 
                    cross it!<br></p>
